# MNIST-Classification-with-NeuralNet
MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification using 3 Layer Neural Net  98.7% Accuracy

**Classifying the MNIST Digits using 3 Layer Neural Networks

Deskewing the Images yields much good accuracy, 
**Accuracy was 98.7% after deskewing the images
before it was 98.4% simple 3 Layer Neural Nets.
